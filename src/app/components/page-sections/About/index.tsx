        <span>Hello, I&apos;m Matheus Finatto, a web developer.</span>
        <br />
        I have Bachelor&apos;s degrees in both Computer Science and Business
        Administration.
        <br />
        <br />
        My expertise includes React, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3,
        GraphQL, REST APIs, Node.js, and Express.js. I also have experience with
        C++, Java, C# (.NET Framework), and Python.
        <br />
        <br />
        Currently, I work focusing on front-end development with React.
        <br />
        <br />
        Beyond that, I am also interested in back-end development and machine
        learning. I am always looking to explore new technologies and enhance my
        skill set.
        <br />
        <br />
